# `UICollectionViewFlowLayout` Example

This is a small app that shows yo how to use simple `UICollectionViewFlowLayout` sublcasses and transition between them. You can get a lot of really nice layouts without any further modification than `init`.

I might add some more cool layouts later. This is all in anticipation for a book on `UICollectionView` I'm working on. Keep your ears open for news of it.
